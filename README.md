## Tech Refresh 2015 Xamarin Demos

### Session: Strategies for Developing Cross-Platform Applications

This repository contains the code of the Demos shown in this session/event.
  
Do not consider this code as being optimal (from perfomance and architecture perspective) as it was meant to only quickly showcase Xamarin.

###Folders:

#### XamarinDemoBasic
This is the first part of the Demo, which has the Meme Generator app working on iOS/Android/Windows Phone

#### XamarinDemoWithBand
This is the second part of the Demo, basically it's the first part, but the Windows Phone project is changed to allow the installation of the "Chuck Norris Jokes" app on a Microsoft Band
